# VGA checkerboard display with a red square that moves along the board in response to pressing push-buttons. 

The VGA checkerboard displays a red square that moves along the board in response to either pressing push-buttons on the development board.

The VGA checkerboard display is written in VHDL for the NEXYS A7 (formerly NEXYS4) FPGA development board which is designed around the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.

Please access and download the Word doc "Theory of VGA Checkerboard Display" for a fuller description of theory and implementation.

To configure the VGA checkerboard display and use it you will need the following dependencies:
* Xilinx Vivado       
* Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA or compatible board
* VGA monitor and cable
* provided files in VGA Checkerboard VHDL code files folder
